General presentation
====================

Zope 3 is a complete framework that makes it possible to develop web 
applications using Python. Much of this framework can be used in any Python
application, independent of what represents, historically, a Zope application.

The development of Zope 3 began in 2001-2002, in part as a reaction to the 
experience gained through developing the Zope 2 application server. The first
version (Zope 3.0) was published in 2004.

The design of the infrastructure that represents Zope 3 was largely centered on
the needs of big companies and the clients of the Zope Corporation, having in 
mind applications with a big level of complexity. As such, Zope 3 can be used
in developing complex application, its best use being in such environments.

The main components that make it possible to develop Zope applications are:

* publishing a graph of objects through various protocols, tipically http
* an infrastructure similar to MVC for page publishing
* a security system that can be applied to any object, including pages
* integrates the Zope Component Architecture (ZCA)

Typically, a Zope application would include:

* integration with zc.buildout, to build the application infrastructure
* files to configure the server, maybe even integration with PasteScript
* a module that starts the application (startup.py)
* code packages and ZCML that will implement the desired application
