The future of the Zope 3 platform
=================================
The main purpose of the Zope 3 platform, that to build a component based web
framework, has been achieved. Zope right now is built on mature libraries, 
hardened by years of deployment in various online applications. They are stable
and will not require any extensive changes in the near future. The developers
that use this platform are experienced developers, usually involved in complex 
projects that drive the development of new conex libraries or refining the 
existing ones. The number of developers using the Zope 3 platform is rising, 
thanks to:

* migrating to Zope 3 of some popular systems such as Plone
* the Repoze initiative, with its offer of Zope libraries repackaged and ready
  to use in any other web framework
* new CMS projects (z3ext, vudo, hivurt, etc), which run of the Zope libraries

New development directions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Although the core is considered to be complete, the Zope Community keeps 
improving the platform. Several areas are considered to be essential to be on
the roadmap:

* Decrease the level of interdependencies between the code Zope packages. This
  will lead to a better usage of resources (less RAM, etc) and the complexity
  as it is apparent to the developers
* Promote alternative solutions to those offered by Zope by default: 
  compatibility with WSGI, integration with RDBs through ORMs, etc.
* Lowering the entry levels for new developers, through the Grok platform, 
  which is a simple and powerful way to developer web applications on the 
  Zope 3 platform
* Repoze.bfg, a new independent webdevelopment framework that is based on 
  libraries from Zope 3,  WebOb and WSGI, has a strong integration of Zope 3 
  concepts, but with the intended purpose of reducing the interdependence 
  among components. It wants to be agnostic about the choices and offer multiple
  paths to solving some key problems (such as persistency, template engine, 
  etc). 
* the **chameleon** templating engine has a better performance and offers
  several syntax implementations (ZPT, Genshi) and integration with some of 
  the key Zope and Zope Community packages.
