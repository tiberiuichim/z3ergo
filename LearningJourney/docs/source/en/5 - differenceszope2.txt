Differences to Zope 2
=====================
The programmers that have developed on the Zope 2 platform need to take the 
following into consideration:

Radical change in concepts
--------------------------
Although some concepts from Zope and CMF are kept, there are enough changes
that the two systems can be considered completely different. Even so, a Zope 2
programmer will have a shorter and easier learning period.

Through the web development
---------------------------
TTW development is discouraged in Zope 3. The facilities provided by Zope 3 for 
TTW are limited and need to be enabled explicitely.

Acquisition
-----------
It is limited and explicit (even more, it is not used by the community). Some
of the problems that acquisition solved are not longer valid (TTW development),
or solve through other paradigms: local utilities, registered at site levels
and an inteligent system of layers and skins implemented in Python code.

RestrictedPython
----------------
Once TTW development is no longer used, RPython is not necessary. This makes it
possible to have unrestricted access to objects in ZPT (the objects are still
wrapped in security proxies, so the objects need an explicit declaration of
security settings).
