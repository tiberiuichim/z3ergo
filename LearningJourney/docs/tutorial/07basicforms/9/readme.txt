Enhancing the edit object with automatic forms
-----------------------------------------------

* zope.app.form provides a way to automatically create edit forms based on schemas
* so we declare a new "editform" and specify that it should appear in the zmi_views menu
* erased the two edit pages declaration, they're no longer used
* changeBook from the BookViews is no longer needed
